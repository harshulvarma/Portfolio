## Projects:
### [Analysing and Predicting Customer Retention](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Customer_Churn.ipynb)
Trying this [link](https://github.com/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Customer_Churn.ipynb)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** of customer churn behaviour based on 26 features such as demographics, services, billing and charges
- Discovered most important features that are responsible for customer churn using **Random Forest Classifier**
- Developed a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave or not

### [Segmenting customers based on Credit Card usage](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Credit_Card_User_Segmentation.ipynb)
- Segmented customers based on credit card usage for banks to target clusters with appropriate marketing strategies
- Discovered highly correlated features using Pearson correlation and feature engineered the dataset
- Utilised K-Means in scikit-learn for cluster analysis and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualise clusters

### [Air quality analysis and prediction - Madrid](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/air_quality_analysis_and_prediction_Madrid.ipynb)
- Analysed effect of altitude on pollution levels in Madrid air stations
- Clusterd and anlaysed similiar air stations using **K-Means**
- Visualised yearly, monthly and hourly trends of 2001-2018 major pollutant levels
- Modelled and Evaluated Long Short Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network (**LSTM-RNN**) to predict NO2 levels

### [Pneumonia detection in X-Ray Images](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Pneumonia_X-Ray_Images.ipynb)
- Implemented **transfer learning** using fine-tuned **ResNet50** architecture in Keras to predict Pneumonia in X-Ray images 
- The dataset was evaluated on various machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures but yielded best results using ResNet50 with Data Augmentation
- The final model is evaluated based on Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision and Recall

### [Finding Similiar Neighborhoods -Toronto](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Finding_Similar_Neighborhoods.ipynb)
- Scraped, cleaned and analysed Toronto postal area, borough and neighbourhood data
- Used **Foursquare API** to get popular venues in each neighborhood
- Clustered neighborhoods based on common venues using **K-Means unsupervised learning**
- Found similiar neighborhoods based on euclidean distances
