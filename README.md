## About me:

Over the years I have developed a passion to solve problems using analytical techniques while using latest technologies. I believe in constant learning and applying the gained knowledge to meaningful projects.

This portfolio consists of projects I've worked on to demonstrate my skills in various aspects of Data Science (data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis and machine learning)

Tools I use/currently learning: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, tensorflow, Keras), SQL, Tableau, d3.js, R

## Projects:

### [IBM Customer Churn Prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/CustomerChurn.ipynb)

Predicting churn using XGBoost classifier and identifying the features that can be used to predict churn using EDA and feature importance

### [Air quality analysis and prediction - Madrid](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/air_quality_analysis_and_prediction_Madrid.ipynb)
Visualised 18 years of time series data of Madridâ€™s air pollution to discover trends and seasonality, clustered air stations in Madrid based on pollutant levels using K-means to find key areas in Madrid with highest pollution and finally forecasted pollution level for next 2 years by modelling and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) using Keras and Tensorflow

### [Segmenting customers based on Credit Card usage](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/Credit_Card_User_Segmentation.ipynb)
Segmented customers based on credit card usage behaviour for banks to target clusters with appropriate marketing strategies and visualised the clusters using PCA
