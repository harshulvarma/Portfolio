## Projects:
### Analysing and Predicting Customer Retention
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** of customer churn behaviour based on 26 features such as demographics, services, billing and charges
- Discovered most important features that are responsible for customer churn using **Random Forest Classifier*
- Developed a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave or not

### Air quality analysis and prediction - Madrid
- Analysed effect of altitude on pollution levels in Madrid air stations
- Clusterd and anlaysed similiar air stations using **K-Means**
- Visualised yearly, monthly and hourly trends of 2001-2018 major pollutant levels
- Modelled and Evaluated Long Short Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network (**LSTM-RNN**) to predict NO2 levels

### Breast Cancer Detection in Histology Images
- Implemented **transfer learning** using fine-tuned **ResNet50** architecture in Keras achieved 85% accuracy in predicting breast cancer in histology images 
- The dataset was evaluated on various machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures and utilising data augmentation but yielded best results ResNet50

### Finding Similiar Neighborhoods -Toronto
- Scraped, cleaned and analysed Toronto postal area, borough and neighbourhood data
- Used Foursquare API to get popular venues in each neighborhood
- Clustered neighborhoods based on common venues using K-Means unsupervised learning
- Found similiar neighborhoods based on euclidean distances
