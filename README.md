## Projects:

### [Health Lifestyle Prediction App](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/health_lifestyle_prediction_app.ipynb)

Classifying the health lifestyle of users based on simple input features such as resting heartrate and BMI. Focus of the project was feature selection and hyperparameter tuning of the machine learning model and deployment of a web app on Heroku using streamlit. App can be accessed here: https://health-lifestyle-prediction.herokuapp.com/

### [Air quality analysis and prediction - Madrid](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harshulvarma/Portfolio/blob/master/air_quality_analysis_and_prediction_Madrid.ipynb)
Visualised 18 years of time series data of Madridâ€™s air pollution to discover trends and seasonality, clustered air stations in Madrid based on pollutant levels using K-means to find key areas in Madrid with highest pollution and finally forecasted pollution level for next 2 years by modelling and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) using Keras and Tensorflow
